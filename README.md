# Unity Explorer: Puck Edition

## Summary

This is the repository for the code used to adapt *sinai-dev*'s UnityExplorer to the built-in Puck mod loading system. In essence, it loads UnityExplorer within the constraints of the IPuckMod interface. All I (*blamedlurker*) did was make it work -- all of the UnityExplorer functionality is *sinai-dev*'s and, as far as I can ascertain, has not been modified whatsoever.
